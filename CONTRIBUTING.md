# Contributing to JokesOnYou

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to **JokesOnYou**, Here we create website where people can view and rate jokes.
We formed this project to learn about web development using C# as main Language.
This should be a learning project for all aspects. The Building, Coding, Documenting and Teaching.
Itâ€™s people like you that make it a reality for users in our community.
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. clone the project's `dev` branch.
2. Make a new branch of `dev` and name it accordingly to the issue it solves ( [see here for the exact format for naming](https://github.com/Code2Gether-Discord/JokesOnYou/wiki/How-To-Backlog#pull-requests))
3. Commit changes to that branch you named descriptive of the issue.
4. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this project.
5. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
6. Ensure the test suite passes.
7. Make sure your code lints.
8. Make a fetch and pull for the descriptive branch you've created.
9. Merge it with `dev` branch.
10. Make a PR on `dev` branch, stating and linking the issue it solves.

### Note:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.

- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.

- Feel free to ask doubts and discuss issues in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/fkksvX7YPR).

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

**Please check that your Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

The more specific and thorough your Bug Report , it is more likely to get solved.
